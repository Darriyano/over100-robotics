			The main objective of our project is to create a web application for controlling a robot
			developed by the Robotics Laboratory of Innopolis University. The project provides the
			possibility of manual and automatic control of the robot, assessment of its condition and
			possible damage. The application has a simple and intuitive interface, which will make it
			easier for future users to learn. The project uses React, ROS2 and other libraries. The main
			language used is Typescript. In the future, it is planned to debug the work of the project,
			make it integrable with other robots and start scaling it.
